# DualFinder
A trainable convolutional neural network designed to predict dual AGN candidates in large sky survey fields, with a comprehensive tutorial for how to design, train, and test the model.

**Data Download**: Since we cannot store large files in this GitHub repository, you can find all of the directories for pretrained models, training datasets, and data visualization using this link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/y7mv5g6zkog15xppm7sa5/AKzHkCDeBPiwJrEof6J9ppk?rlkey=i7m1sjqlgstyidss1l1n4b78h&st=fxij06wd&dl=0
Please note that some cells in the tutorial Jupyter Notebook may not run without these downloads. Please add the `Double_AGN_CNN`, `confirmed_single_AGN_fall`, `Gaussian_simulated_images` to the `preprocess` module folder when you clone this repository.
